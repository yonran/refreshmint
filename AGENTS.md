# Agent Guidelines

## Commits

- Use subject + body format (blank line between).
- If the change is non-obvious, the body must explain why.
- Add a separate co-author paragraph after the body.
- The co-author line must include the exact model name and use the format:
    - `Co-authored-by: Codex (<MODEL_NAME>) <codex@users.noreply.github.com>`
